/**
 * Arc's map of the app: every operator-facing surface, what it's for, where it
 * lives (deep-link route), and which tools read/write it. Single source of truth
 * for wayfinding ("where do I do X / take me to Y") and the coverage backbone the
 * later slices plug into. Routes mirror the app's real nav; the app-map.test.ts
 * drift test keeps the tool names honest against the real runner tool registry.
