# Hyper-Personalization Product Goals

## Working Prompt

Use this prompt when asking an AI agent to enhance the Big Shoulders Growth Engine:

```text
You are helping build the Big Shoulders Restoration Growth Engine, a standalone Next.js and Supabase martech application for a restoration company.

Before proposing or writing code, inspect the current app and preserve its existing product boundaries:
- The core data foundation is companies, contacts, properties, leads, jobs, and outcomes.
- The official persona system must remain the base taxonomy.
- `unassigned_persona` is internal-only and must never be accepted for new lead ingestion or AI routing.
- The product should stay focused on flood, water backup, burst pipe, storm surge, standing water, mold, sewage, fire, and related restoration demand. Hail-only, wind-only, exterior-only roof, and unrelated remodeling workflows should be downgraded, isolated, or blocked from campaign generation.
- Outbound marketing must remain coverage-neutral. Do not generate or publish copy that promises insurance coverage, claim approval, or payout outcomes.

Goal:
Enhance the Growth Engine from a static persona CRM into a hyper-personalized marketing operating system. The app should understand each person, company, property, partner, lead, and campaign at a living profile level, then recommend the next best message, channel, offer, and action with human approval before anything external is sent.

Research and incorporate useful patterns from modern marketing, home-service, and local-service software such as HubSpot, ServiceTitan Marketing Pro, CallRail, Podium, Hatch, Birdeye, HighLevel, ActiveCampaign, Google Business Profile workflows, Google Ads, and weather intelligence tools. Do not copy their generic product model blindly. Translate the useful ideas into a restoration-specific system for Big Shoulders Restoration.

Design and implementation priorities:
1. Add a persona intelligence layer above the official base personas.
2. Add hyper-persona snapshots for contacts, companies, properties, leads, jobs, outcomes, and campaigns.
3. Add engagement events and timeline views for email, SMS, call, form, website, review, social, ad, and partner-referral activity.
4. Add campaign objects that connect persona, loss focus, offer, channel, assets, approval state, and attribution.
5. Add next-best-action logic that uses urgency, relationship stage, engagement, revenue, partner health, and current business capacity.
6. Add a human approval queue with prompt inputs, generated output, compliance status, edit controls, and dispatch lock.
7. Add competitor/software intelligence so the team can track what other apps do, what tools they use, what features are worth adapting, and what demos or screenshots still need review.
8. Add integration readiness for call tracking, form tracking, SMS, email, reviews, ads, Google Business Profile, Linear, Google Drive, Supabase, and analytics.
9. Add reporting that ties campaigns, personas, partners, sources, jobs, outcomes, margin, and response time together.

When proposing changes, return:
- A concise product thesis.
- The exact app modules or routes to add/change.
- The proposed data model additions.
- The user workflows enabled.
- The competitor/app pattern being adapted.
- The safest implementation sequence.
- Tests or verification needed.
- Risks, open questions, and what should stay out of scope.
```

## North Star

The Growth Engine should become a restoration-specific persona intelligence and campaign execution system.

The app should not stop at assigning a contact to `persona_insurance_agent` or `persona_plumbing_partner`. It should create a living, explainable profile that answers:

- Who is this person or organization?
- What do they care about right now?
- What loss situation, property context, or partner context are they connected to?
- What have they done recently?
- How valuable is the relationship?
- What is the safest next action?
- What message, channel, offer, and proof point should be used?
- What must be reviewed by a human before anything is sent?

## Product Thesis

Generic marketing apps automate campaigns. The Big Shoulders Growth Engine should understand restoration context.

The differentiator is not "AI marketing." The differentiator is a system that knows the difference between an emergency homeowner with standing water, an insurance agent needing coverage-neutral documentation, a plumbing partner who has not referred in 42 days, and a property manager watching multiple buildings after a storm.

## Current Foundation

The current application already has the right base layer:

- Six CRM objects: companies, contacts, properties, leads, jobs, and outcomes.
- Official persona mappings.
- Internal-only `unassigned_persona` fallback.
- Lead ingestion validation.
- Flood and water-loss routing.
- Deterministic lead and partner scoring.
- AI Studio campaign workspace mockups.
- Reports and attribution mockups.
- Supabase schema foundation.

The next phase should build on this foundation rather than replacing it.

## Hyper-Persona Model

A base persona is the top-level category. A hyper-persona is the current operating profile.

Example:

```json
{
  "basePersona": "persona_insurance_agent",
  "relationshipStage": "warm_partner",
  "valueTier": "high",
  "recentBehavior": "dormant_30_days",
  "dominantLossPattern": "basement_water_backup",
  "preferredChannel": "email",
  "messagePosture": "concise_documentation_first",
  "recommendedOffer": "coverage_neutral_referral_packet",
  "nextBestAction": "send_agent_documentation_packet",
  "riskFlags": ["coverage_neutral_language_required"],
  "generatedAt": "ISO timestamp"
}
```

## Persona Intelligence Dimensions

The app should score or classify each record across these dimensions:

- Base persona: official persona enum.
- Situation context: active water, standing water, burst pipe, storm event, property type, urgency, after-hours signal.
- Relationship context: cold lead, warm referral, active partner, dormant partner, high-value source, low-quality source.
- Behavior context: email opens, SMS replies, form submissions, call activity, referral submissions, review activity, document downloads.
- Value context: revenue, margin, conversion rate, referral quality, job outcomes, response time.
- Channel context: preferred channel, last successful channel, blocked channel, compliance risk.
- Message context: CTA, offer, proof points, tone, forbidden claims, approval status.
- Capacity context: business state such as high capacity with low volume or low capacity with high volume.

## Open Questions

- Which external systems will Big Shoulders actually use first for calls, SMS, email, reviews, and ads?
- Should campaigns publish externally from this app, or should the app only prepare and approve assets?
- Which personas should get active nurture first?
- What is the minimum owner approval workflow that feels useful but not heavy?
- Which competitor tools should be demoed first?
- What weather data source is practical for the first version?
- How much auto-personalization is acceptable before a human must review?
