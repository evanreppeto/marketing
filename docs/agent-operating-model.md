# Agent Operating Model

## Goal

Build the Big Shoulders Growth Engine as a backend-first operating layer for the Hermes agent, with visible, accountable AI work that humans can inspect, approve, decline, revise, and measure.

Hermes is the primary operator. The web UI is the control room: it helps Hermes, Robby, and the team see the work, understand why it happened, and intervene when a human decision is required.

The app should not hide AI behind a generic "generate" button. It should show agent work clearly:

- What the agent is trying to do.
- Which records, personas, campaigns, and events it used.
- What it produced.
- What risk flags were found.
- What still needs human approval.
- What happened after the work was approved or rejected.

## Product Thesis

The Growth Engine should become an agentic marketing operations system for restoration.

Generic marketing software automates tasks. The Big Shoulders system should coordinate specialized agents that understand water-loss urgency, partner relationships, persona context, local demand, compliance rules, and owner approval gates.

The important difference is accountability. Every agent output should be inspectable, editable, and tied back to source data.

This app should not be designed as a traditional dashboard where humans drive every workflow. Most value should live in the backend contract: durable records, task queues, approvals, reasoning logs, compliance checks, and integration-ready APIs that Hermes can call. The UI exists for detailed views, approvals, debugging, and occasional operator control.

## Hermes Backend Contract

Hermes should be able to use the app as an operational backend:

- Read CRM, persona, campaign, approval, and task context through stable APIs.
- Create or update draft tasks, campaign briefs, and generated assets in non-public states.
- Attach prompt inputs, source records, reasoning summaries, compliance flags, and draft outputs.
- Route anything public-facing into approval instead of dispatching it directly.
- Receive clear machine-readable decisions after humans approve, decline, request revision, or archive an item.
- Treat UI actions as state transitions that update backend records, not as cosmetic preview actions once persistence is enabled.

The UI should expose the same contract humans need:

- What Hermes or a sub-agent did.
- Which data it used.
- What it produced.
- Why the output is recommended or blocked.
- What approval decision is needed.
- What happens after approval, decline, revision, or archive.

## ContentEngine-Style Approval Pattern

Use the ContentEngine-style review model for campaigns, ads, and other generated assets:

1. Hermes or an agent creates a draft campaign, ad, script, one-pager, post, or message.
2. The draft enters an approval queue with prompt input, source records, generated output, risk flags, and compliance notes.
3. A human can approve, decline, request revision, or archive.
4. Approve unlocks the asset for the next backend step, such as export, scheduling, dispatch eligibility, or campaign activation.
5. Decline keeps the asset blocked and records decision notes.
6. Request revision creates a new agent task linked to the original draft and approval item.
7. Archive removes the item from active review without making it usable.

Approval and decline are product-critical state changes. They should eventually be persisted as auditable records, not only URL query previews.

## Core Principle

Agents can recommend, draft, research, score, summarize, and prepare work.

Agents should not independently publish ads, send emails, send SMS, alter public landing pages, or make coverage-related claims without explicit approval.

## Agent Safety Rules

### Hard Blocks

Agents must not:

- Promise insurance coverage.
- State that a claim will be approved.
- Guarantee payouts.
- Publish client-facing messages without approval.
- Send SMS or email without approval.
- Generate hail-only or wind-only campaign assets unless the task is explicitly to reject, block, or route them out of scope.
- Modify core CRM records without a preview and explicit user action.

### Required Review

Human approval is required for:

- Public website copy.
- Paid ad copy.
- Email campaigns.
- SMS campaigns.
- Review responses.
- Partner packets.
- One-pagers.
- Any content that references insurance, claims, coverage, timelines, pricing, or urgency.

### Allowed Without Approval

Agents may do these internally:

- Summarize records.
- Recommend next actions.
- Draft content.
- Flag risks.
- Create internal task suggestions.
- Generate campaign briefs in draft state.
- Score confidence.
- Suggest competitor features to research.

2. Compliance Agent checks restricted phrases and scope.
3. Approval item is created.
4. Owner reviews prompt inputs and output side by side.
5. Owner edits, approves, rejects, or requests revision.
6. Only approved assets become eligible for dispatch or publishing.

### Workflow 4: Partner Reactivation

1. Referral Growth Agent detects a dormant high-value partner.
2. Agent reviews prior referrals, outcomes, engagement, and persona snapshot.
3. Agent recommends a partner-specific next action.
4. Agent drafts an email, call script, or one-pager.

## Open Questions

- Should agents run only when a user clicks a button, or also on schedules?
- Which outputs should require owner approval versus manager approval?
- Should approved assets be dispatched by this app or exported to external tools?
- Which external AI provider should run the first live agent?
- How much agent reasoning should be stored in `reasoning_json`?
- Should competitor research become its own agent before content production?
- What is the first real integration: CallRail, Google Business Profile, email, SMS, or forms?
