 * PROD smoke — the unauthenticated checks that need no seeded data or
 * credentials, so they are safe to run against the live production site on a
 * schedule. This is deliberately narrow: it proves prod is up and the login
 * wall still holds. The full authenticated flow (sign in, tenant renders,
 * opportunity inbox, approval gate) lives in e2e/guardrails.spec.ts and runs
 * against staging (and prod too, once PROD_E2E_EMAIL / PROD_E2E_PASSWORD secrets
 * are set — see e2e-guardrails.yml).
 *
 * Point it at prod with E2E_BASE_URL:
 *   E2E_BASE_URL=https://arc-studio.ai pnpm exec playwright test e2e/prod-smoke.spec.ts
