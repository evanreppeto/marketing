/**
 * End-to-end GUARDRAILS for the deployed app (target: prod — staging was retired
 * 2026-07-16 to cut Vercel cost). These assert the things that would be genuinely
 * scary if they silently broke:
 *   1. the login wall holds — the public can't see the app,
 *   2. a real operator can sign in and the tenant renders,
 *   3. the Opportunity inbox is populated,
 *   4. the campaign approval surface is present (the human gate exists).
 *
 * Every check is READ-ONLY — a sign-in plus three GETs. Nothing is sent,
 * approved, or written, which is what makes them safe to run against prod.
 *
 * Reliable by design: sign-in goes through the real API (no fragile form
 * selectors), and assertions match on visible text (not brittle CSS) — and on
 * shape rather than specific records, so they don't break when the workspace's
 * real data changes. Point it at any deploy with E2E_BASE_URL:
 *
 *   E2E_BASE_URL=https://arc-studio.ai pnpm exec playwright test e2e/guardrails.spec.ts
