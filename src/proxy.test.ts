/**
 * The matcher decides whether the auth gate runs at all, so a path missing from it
 * fails silently and in the worst direction — the gate answers with a 302 to /login
 * and the caller believes it got a real response.
 *
 * That is exactly how Sentry's tunnel broke: the browser SDK POSTed each error to
 * /monitoring, the proxy redirected it to /login, the SDK saw the login page's 200,
 * reported `flushed: true`, and no event ever reached Sentry. Every field was
 * configured correctly; delivery was dead. Only reading the network caught it.
