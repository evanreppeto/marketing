 * The Outbox's four summary tiles.
 *
 * One rule, because this is the send surface and a mislabelled unit here is a
 * question about what just went out: **the value counts dispatches; reach lives in
 * the sub.**
 *
 * "Sent" used to break it — its value read a recipient sum while its sub said
 * "recorded dispatches", so prod showed `4,384 / recorded dispatches` for 2
 * dispatches to 4,384 people. Three tiles counted dispatches, one counted people,
 * and the odd one named itself after the unit it wasn't using. Against a 200-lead
 * CRM, "4,384 dispatches" is alarming rather than merely wrong.
