// the cost-governance path: a PAID third-party data vendor. Read-only — it derives
// permit-backed opportunity candidates deterministically from its per-workspace
// config (the municipalities to watch) and makes NO write. A production build
// swaps detect() for a real permit/property API (BSR-368 enrichment); the shape
// stays identical.
//
// Cost model: each watched municipality is one billable lookup. The detection
// orchestrator authorises the run against the workspace spend cap and records the
// units it actually scanned — see estimateBillableUnits + src/lib/connectors/metering.ts.

/**
 * No permit source exists yet, so there are no permit findings to report — [].
 *
 * This used to invent one. From a municipality NAME the operator typed, and nothing
 * else, it asserted `"Paid permit records flagged fresh renovation/restoration
 * filings in {municipality}"` at confidence 65 — and estimateBillableUnits charged a
 * metered lookup per municipality for the invention. The `evidence.note` said
 * "Stub", but the title and summary read as source-backed, and the inbox shows the
 * title. An operator cannot tell a fabricated finding from a real one by looking.
 *
 * That is strictly worse than proposing nothing: a connector that stays quiet costs
 * an operator nothing, while one that invents source-backed findings spends their
 * money and their trust. Same reasoning as the weather service-area default (#473)
 * and the filter that stopped Air Quality alerts being filed as storm damage (#499).
 *
 * When a real permit/property API lands (BSR-368), give this the shape its siblings
 * already have — reviews-signal and competitor-ads take injectable sources and
 * return [] when unconfigured, which is why neither of them ever invented anything.
 * The metering path around it (estimateBillableUnits + the cap check) is real and
 * stays: it prices what a scan WOULD cost, which is what the cost-governance work
 * needed a reference consumer for.
