 * runColdLeadDetection is what writes the Opportunity Inbox — 64 of prod's 82 open
 * cards came from it. Every test that mentioned it mocked it with vi.fn(), so its
 * body had never once executed under test: the suite stayed green while the card
 * titles it produces were "Lead c1aa307a" for months.
 *
 * This runs the real thing against a fake client, and asserts on the candidates it
 * hands to persistence — the actual product of the function.
