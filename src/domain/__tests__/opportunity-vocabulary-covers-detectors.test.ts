/**
 * The vocabulary is what Arc is ALLOWED to say. The detectors are what the app
 * says on its own. So everything a detector can emit, Arc must be able to propose
 * — otherwise the agent is barred from a category its own product already renders.
 *
 * The first cut of the vocabulary missed exactly this. `detectNextIterationOpportunities`
 * emits kind "next_iteration" on subject "campaign", and the inbox renders it as
 * "Repeat a winner" — but neither value was on the list, so Arc could no longer
 * suggest repeating a winning campaign. It was invisible: the detectors call
 * upsertOpportunities directly and never touch parseOpportunityProposal, so nothing
 * failed; only the agent quietly lost a category. Prod carries no such rows yet, so
 * the data couldn't show it either.
 *
 * Asserting on the detectors' real output rather than on a hand-kept list, so
 * adding a detector kind and forgetting the vocabulary fails here.
